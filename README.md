===========

Factors a positive integer in what I am sure is a very inefficient
manner (wouldn't recommend trying an integer with more than 5 digits).

Examples:

Please enter an integer greater than one:   
 0 <br>
Your response was not greater than one.


Please enter an integer greater than one:   
 5 <br>
5


Please enter an integer greater than one:   
 99 <br>
3*3*11


Please enter an integer greater than one:   
 66666 <br>
2*3*41*271
